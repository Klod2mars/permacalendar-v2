--- Audit Home UI Report --- 
Branch: assistant/fix/use-default-dashboard-asset
Working tree: untracked cursor_audit_home_ui.yaml

Build & install:
- flutter build apk --debug (success)
- adb install -r build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk (success)
- App activity reported as resumed (dumpsys)

Screenshot status:
- Captured file: home_screen_screenshot.png (15495 bytes)
- Screenshot shows Samsung AOD/lock screen clock, not the app Home UI.
- Attempts: keyevent 26/82/menu, swipe unlock, wm dismiss-keyguard, svc power stayon usb; result unchanged (likely needs manual unlock).

Extracted UI text via uiautomator dump (OCR fallback):
android.widget.TextView | [243,271][470,451] | 17
android.widget.TextView | [470,271][550,451] | :
android.widget.TextView | [550,271][837,451] | 38
android.widget.TextView | [344,474][736,542] | dim. 9 novembre
Key code findings:
- lib/shared/widgets/organic_dashboard.dart defaults to assets/images/backgrounds/dashboard_organic_final.png with diagnostics and fallback.
- HomeScreen uses Image.asset('assets/images/backgrounds/dashboard_organic_final.png') inside Intelligence section debug card after rootBundle.load check.

Assets check:
- assets/images/backgrounds/dashboard_organic_final.png exists (size 1,727,344 bytes).
- assets/images/backgrounds/organic_dashboard_final.png missing.

AssetManifest verification:
- build/flutter_assets/AssetManifest.json not present after debug build.
- Found manifests: build/app/intermediates/assets/debug/mergeDebugAssets/flutter_assets/AssetManifest.json and build/app/intermediates/flutter/debug/flutter_assets/AssetManifest.json.
  * dashboard_organic_final.png listed; organic_dashboard_final.png absent.

Outstanding issues / recommendations:
1. Provide unlock instructions or manual capture to confirm the dashboard renders; remote screenshot remains locked view.
2. Keep using dashboard_organic_final.png (packaged) or remove stale organic_dashboard_final.png references.
3. Consider automated smoke test to detect asset fallback vs expected background early.
