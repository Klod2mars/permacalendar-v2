  "user_guide_text": "1 — Welcome to Sowing\nSowing is an application designed to support gardeners in the lively and concrete monitoring of their crops.\nIt allows you to:\n• organize your gardens and plots,\n• follow your plantings throughout their life cycle,\n• plan your tasks at the right time,\n• keep a memory of what has been done,\n• take into account local weather and the rhythm of the seasons.\nThe application works mainly offline and keeps your data directly on your device.\nThis manual describes the common use of Sowing: getting started, creating gardens, plantings, calendar, weather, data export and best practices.\n\n2 — Understanding the interface\nThe dashboard\nUpon opening, Sowing displays a visual and organic dashboard.\nIt takes the form of a background image animated by interactive bubbles. Each bubble gives access to a major function of the application:\n• gardens,\n• air weather,\n• soil weather,\n• calendar,\n• activities,\n• statistics,\n• settings.\nGeneral navigation\nSimply touch a bubble to open the corresponding section.\nInside the pages, you will find depending on the context:\n• contextual menus,\n• \"+\" buttons to add an element,\n• edit or delete buttons.\n\n3 — Quick Start\nOpen the application\nAt launch, the dashboard is displayed automatically.\nConfigure the weather\nIn the settings, choose your location.\nThis information allows Sowing to display local weather adapted to your garden. If no location is selected, a default location is used.\nCreate your first garden\nWhen using for the first time, Sowing automatically guides you to create your first garden.\nYou can also create a garden manually from the dashboard.\nOn the main screen, touch the green leaf located in the freest area, to the right of the statistics and slightly above. This deliberately discreet area allows you to initiate the creation of a garden.\nYou can create up to five gardens.\nThis approach is part of the Sowing experience: there is no permanent and central \"+\" button. The application rather invites exploration and progressive discovery of space.\nThe areas linked to the gardens are also accessible from the Settings menu.\nOrganic calibration of the dashboard\nAn organic calibration mode allows:\n• to visualize the real location of interactive zones,\n• to move them by simple sliding of the finger.\nYou can thus position your gardens and modules exactly where you want on the image: at the top, at the bottom or at the place that suits you best.\nOnce validated, this organization is saved and kept in the application.\nCreate a plot\nIn a garden sheet:\n• choose \"Add a plot\",\n• indicate its name, its area and, if necessary, some notes,\n• save.\nAdd a planting\nIn a plot:\n• press the \"+\" button,\n• choose a plant from the catalog,\n• indicate the date, the quantity and useful information,\n• validate.\n\n4 — The organic dashboard\nThe dashboard is the central point of Sowing.\nIt allows:\n• to have an overview of your activity,\n• to quickly access the main functions,\n• to navigate intuitively.\nDepending on your settings, some bubbles may display synthetic information, such as the weather or upcoming tasks.\n\n5 — Gardens, plots and plantings\nThe gardens\nA garden represents a real place: vegetable garden, greenhouse, orchard, balcony, etc.\nYou can:\n• create several gardens,\n• modify their information,\n• delete them if necessary.\nThe plots\nA plot is a precise zone inside a garden.\nIt allows to structure the space, organize crops and group several plantings in the same place.\nThe plantings\nA planting corresponds to the introduction of a plant in a plot, at a given date.\nWhen creating a planting, Sowing offers two modes.\nSow\nThe \"Sow\" mode corresponds to putting a seed in the ground.\nIn this case:\n• the progression starts at 0%,\n• a step-by-step follow-up is proposed, particularly useful for beginner gardeners,\n• a progress bar visualizes the advancement of the crop cycle.\nThis follow-up allows to estimate:\n• the probable start of the harvest period,\n• the evolution of the crop over time, in a simple and visual way.\nPlant\nThe \"Plant\" mode is intended for plants already developed (plants from a greenhouse or purchased in a garden center).\nIn this case:\n• the plant starts with a progression of about 30%,\n• the follow-up is immediately more advanced,\n• the estimation of the harvest period is adjusted consequently.\nChoice of date\nWhen planting, you can freely choose the date.\nThis allows for example:\n• to fill in a planting carried out previously,\n• to correct a date if the application was not used at the time of sowing or planting.\nBy default, the current date is used.\nFollow-up and history\nEach planting has:\n• a progression follow-up,\n• information on its life cycle,\n• crop stages,\n• personal notes.\nAll actions (sowing, planting, care, harvesting) are automatically recorded in the garden history.\n\n6 — Plant catalog\nThe catalog brings together all the plants available when creating a planting.\nIt constitutes an scalable reference base, designed to cover current uses while remaining customizable.\nMain functions:\n• simple and quick search,\n• recognition of common and scientific names,\n• display of photos when available.\nCustom plants\nYou can create your own custom plants from:\nSettings → Plant catalog.\nIt is then possible to:\n• create a new plant,\n• fill in the essential parameters (name, type, useful information),\n• add an image to facilitate identification.\nThe custom plants are then usable like any other plant in the catalog.\n\n7 — Calendar and tasks\nThe calendar view\nThe calendar displays:\n• planned tasks,\n• important plantings,\n• estimated harvest periods.\nCreate a task\nFrom the calendar:\n• create a new task,\n• indicate a title, a date and a description,\n• choose a possible recurrence.\nThe tasks can be associated with a garden or a plot.\nTask management\nYou can:\n• modify a task,\n• delete it,\n• export it to share it.\n\n8 — Activities and history\nThis section constitutes the living memory of your gardens.\nSelection of a garden\nFrom the dashboard, long press a garden to select it.\nThe active garden is highlighted by a light green halo and a confirmation banner.\nThis selection allows to filter the displayed information.\nRecent activities\nThe \"Activities\" tab displays chronologically:\n• creations,\n• plantings,\n• care,\n• harvests,\n• manual actions.\nHistory by garden\nThe \"History\" tab presents the complete history of the selected garden, year after year.\nIt allows in particular to:\n• find past plantings,\n• check if a plant has already been cultivated in a given place,\n• better organize crop rotation.\n\n9 — Air weather and soil weather\nAir weather\nThe air weather provides essential information:\n• outside temperature,\n• precipitation (rain, snow, no rain),\n• day / night alternation.\nThis data helps to anticipate climatic risks and adapt interventions.\nSoil weather\nSowing integrates a soil weather module.\nThe user can fill in a measured temperature. From this data, the application dynamically estimates the evolution of the soil temperature over time.\nThis information allows:\n• to know which plants are really cultivable at a given time,\n• to adjust sowing to real conditions rather than a theoretical calendar.\nReal-time weather on the dashboard\nA central ovoid-shaped module displays at a glance:\n• the state of the sky,\n• day or night,\n• the phase and position of the moon for the selected location.\nTime navigation\nBy sliding your finger from left to right on the ovoid, you browse the forecasts hour by hour, up to more than 12 hours in advance.\nThe temperature and precipitation adjust dynamically during the gesture.\n\n10 — Recommendations\nSowing can offer recommendations adapted to your situation.\nThey rely on:\n• the season,\n• the weather,\n• the state of your plantings.\nEach recommendation specifies:\n• what to do,\n• when to act,\n• why the action is suggested.\n\n11 — Export and sharing\nPDF Export — calendar and tasks\nThe calendar tasks can be exported to PDF.\nThis allows to:\n• share clear information,\n• transmit a planned intervention,\n• keep a readable and dated trace.\nExcel Export — harvests and statistics\nThe harvest data can be exported in Excel format in order to:\n• analyze the results,\n• produce reports,\n• follow the evolution over time.\nDocument sharing\nThe generated documents can be shared via the applications available on your device (messaging, storage, transfer to a computer, etc.).\n\n12 — Backup and best practices\nThe data is stored locally on your device.\nRecommended best practices:\n• make a backup before a major update,\n• export your data regularly,\n• keep the application and the device up to date.\n\n13 — Settings\nThe Settings menu allows to adapt Sowing to your uses.\nYou can notably:\n• choose the language,\n• select your location,\n• access the plant catalog,\n• customize the dashboard.\nDashboard customization\nIt is possible to:\n• reposition each module,\n• adjust the visual space,\n• change the background image,\n• import your own image (feature coming soon).\nLegal information\nFrom the settings, you can consult:\n• the user guide,\n• the privacy policy,\n• the terms of use.\n\n14 — Frequently asked questions\nThe touch zones are not well aligned\nDepending on the phone or display settings, some zones may seem shifted.\nAn organic calibration mode allows to:\n• visualize the touch zones,\n• reposition them by sliding,\n• save the configuration for your device.\nCan I use Sowing without connection?\nYes. Sowing works offline for the management of gardens, plantings, tasks and history.\nA connection is only used:\n• for the recovery of weather data,\n• during the export or sharing of documents.\nNo other data is transmitted.\n\n15 — Final remark\nSowing is designed as a gardening companion: simple, lively and scalable.\nTake the time to observe, note and trust your experience as much as the tool.",
